/// This is a wrap of a producer-consumer queue implemented as a monitor, where there is a mutex guarding the

/// queuing thread producing and notifying waiting threads (consumers) through the same condition variable.

/// Originally written by for a single model (where items are produce: Request, consume: Batch), converted to
/// also work for multiple models where items are produce: (TranslationModel, Request), consume: (TranlsationModel,
/// Batch). This is accomplished by template parameter packs.
///
/// Requires BatchingPoolType to implement the following:
///
/// * produce: `size_t enqueueRequest(...)` (returns number elements produced)
/// * produce (batched): `size_t enqueueRequests(...)` (same, for a whole set at once)
/// * consume: `size_t generateBatch(...)` (returns number of elements available to be consumed)
