// Everything here is inert unless BERGAMOT_LIFECYCLE=1 is set in the

// exactly one relaxed atomic load (`lifecycle::enabled()`), which is why the
// flag is a plain extern atomic read inline here rather than a function-local
// static behind a guard variable.
//
// The live-object counters are the exception: they are maintained
// unconditionally (one relaxed fetch_add per TranslationModel /
// ExpressionGraph construction and destruction, i.e. a handful of times per
// process) so a harness or a test can assert "the destructor actually ran"
// without turning tracing on.
